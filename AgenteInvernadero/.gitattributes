# Standardize line endings across different operating systems.
# This helps prevent "LF will be replaced by CRLF" warnings/errors.

# Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization.
# Git will convert text files to LF when committing, and to OS-native
# line endings (CRLF on Windows, LF on Linux/macOS) when checking out.

# Treat common binary file types explicitly as binary to prevent line ending conversion.
